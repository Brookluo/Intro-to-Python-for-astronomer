## A Brief history of Python

Python was invented by Guido van Rossum in late 80s. Python has three generations, Python 1, 2, and 3. Python 3 is the most recent version, and is the only one currently supported and recommended by the Python foundation. There are many fundamental differences between Python 2 and 3, so if you are using Python 2, think twice and turn away! 

Python is a __dynamically-typed, interpreted__ general-purpose programming language. Dynamically-typed means the type of an object is assigned during runtime of the program. Interpreted means Python is executed with the help of another program: an interpreter. The interpreter translates lines of python code into another machine language (assembly) that a computer can understand and execute.


Bonus: the python ecosystem?
